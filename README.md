ZX Spectrum style text and graphics for python

This project has grown out of the joys and frustrations of retrocomputing. I love the aesthetic of 8-bit machines,
I like the simplicity and convenience of their text and graphics, but actually using old versions of BASIC I find myself
missing the modern conveniences of programming languages like Python.

So I wrote a library to produce ZX Spectrum-style text and graphics - and text and graphics commands - for Python.

Documentation is at https://specgfx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

Current status: specgfx is at the stage where I'd like a bit of feedback. I think the feature set is about right for a
version 1.0, and I've written lots of documentation. However, more error handling is needed, and more testing, before
any sort of version could be considered to be stable. As I say, feedback is welcome.
